**Description**


Interactive Tableau Dashboard Project
This is an interactive Tableau dashboard based on a retail dataset. The dashboard contains four separate visualizations:


Sales by Region (Bar Chart)


Profit vs Sales by Category (Scatter Plot)


Average Shipping Cost Over Time (Line Chart)


Order Priority Distribution (Pie Chart)


The dashboard is built so that you can filter the data dynamically by year, segment, region, and shipping mode to create a dashboard that is easy to explore data and insights.
